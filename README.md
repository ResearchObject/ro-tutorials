## Overview

The core [Research Object principles](http://www.researchobject.org/overview/) are:

**Identity**: Use globally unique identifiers as names for things

**Aggregation**: Use some mechanism of aggregation to associate things that are related or part of the broader investigation, study, etc. 

**Annotation**: Provide additional metadata about those things, how they relate to each other, where they came from, when etc.
