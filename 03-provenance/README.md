# Tutorial 3: Provenance of a Research Object

This is part of [developer tutorials](../) for creating and consuming
[Research Objects](http://www.researchobject.org/) (RO).
This tutorial is programming language-agnostic, but assumes some
general [JSON](http://json.org/) and Linux/UNIX shell knowledge.
(Translating shell commands to Windows PowerShell equivalent is left as an exercise for the reader.)
